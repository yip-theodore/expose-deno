Project Status / Disclaimer
A word of caution: Deno is very much under development.
We encourage brave early adopters, but expect bugs large and small. The API is subject to change without notice. Bug reports do help!
We are actively working towards 1.0, but there is no date guarantee.

## https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/2473
Update March 6, 2020: There's a difficult balance to be had between trying to get it right and shipping a usable product. The repository continues to see rapid development and we have yet to make substantial progress on the major missing feature: dev tool support. Therefore we are bumping the release date yet again. However instead of blindly estimating several weeks out, we've discussed it at length and decided 2 months would be enough time. This coincidentally is around the 2 year anniversary since the first commit. Therefore we are setting the date of May 13, 2020 as the 1.0 release date. Contributors are encouraged to get any major API changes in before April 20 - after that date we will be polishing and bug fixing. Of course the API will continue to evolve and improve after 1.0, but we will be making explicit stability guarantees for some interfaces.
